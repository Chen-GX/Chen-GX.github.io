<h3>C-3PO</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
C-3PO is a lightweight multi-agent system (with only 0.5B or 1.5B parameters) that optimizes the entire RAG pipeline through collaborative agents performing systematic search planning, goal decomposition, and intelligent query refinement. Inspired by human search behavior, our three specialized agents work together to bridge the gap between retrievers and LLMs without modifying either component.</p>
