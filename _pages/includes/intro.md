Here is **Guoxin Chen** (**陈国鑫**).

I am now a second-year master student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
My research focuses primarily on Natural Language Processing and Graph Mining.

Currently, I have a strong research interest focusing on Natural Language Reasoning (particularly mathematical reasoning), Tool Learning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation. I am committed to enabling LLMs to possess human-like reasoning and tool-using capabilities.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *gx.chen.chn[at]gmail.com*
